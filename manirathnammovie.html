            <h3>Maniratnam Hits</h3><br>
            <p>Gopalaratnam Subramaniam (born 2 June 1956), known professionally as Mani Ratnam, is an Indian film director, film producer and screenwriter who predominantly works in Tamil cinema and few Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada films.[1] He is one of India's most acclaimed and commercially successful filmmakers.[citation needed] Ratnam has won seven National Film Awards, four Filmfare Awards, six Filmfare Awards South,[2] and numerous awards at various film festivals across the world. In 2002, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, acknowledging his contributions to film.Despite being born into a film family, Mani Ratnam did not develop any interest in films when he was young.[3] Upon completion of his post graduation in management, he started his career as a consultant.[3] He entered the film industry through the 1983 Kannada film, Pallavi Anu Pallavi. The failure of his subsequent films would mean that he would be left with fewer offers. After working in Telugu and Malayalam Cinema, he made his major breakthrough with Mouna Ragam (1986), established him as a leading filmmaker in Tamil cinema which won him his first Filmfare Best Director Award.
