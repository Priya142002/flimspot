            <h3>Anniyan Movie</h3><br>
            <p>Anniyan (transl. Stranger) is a 2005 Indian Tamil-language psychological action thriller film co-written and directed by S. Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran. The film centres on a disillusioned everyman, whose frustration at what he sees as increasing social apathy and public negligence leads to a split personality that attempts to improve the system. Vikram stars in the main lead as Ambi, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who has multiple personality disorder and develops two other identities: a fashion model named Remo and a murderous vigilante named Anniyan. Sadha, Vivek, Nedumudi Venu, Nassar and Prakash Raj feature in supporting roles.Shankar conceived the film in mid-2003 during the post-production period of his previous film, Boys. He based the film on his own life experiences during his formative years when he was disturbed by what he saw around him, and his eventual displeasure with the society. Pre-production for Anniyan began in November 2003 and principal photography in March 2004. The making of the film, which included numerous production delays, took 14 months. The film was shot at Hyderabad, Thanjavur, Tindivanam and Chennai, and the song sequences were filmed in Mumbai, Malaysia, Amsterdam and Tenkasi. The film was notable for its recreation of the Tyagaraja Aradhana music festival and the extensive use of time slice photography in an action sequence.
