            <h3>Paris Jayaraj Movie</h3><br>
            <p>Parris Jeyaraj, a small-time YouTube singer, resorts to drinking after a heartbreak inflicted upon him by his father. Unknown to the fact that she is his father's second wife's daughter, he falls in love with Dhivya after meeting her at an event at her college. Dhivya, also reeling from a love failure because of her father, falls for him without knowing that Parris is the son of her father with his first wife. Little did they know that their relationship would face unexpected trouble with their father being the same. Jeyaraj's father, Prakash Raj, finds that his daughter and son are in love and thus, puts his best foot forward to separate them. Meanwhile, Dhivya's ex-boyfriend also comes back, with an apology for her, with the help of his father and uncle, who were trying to kill Prakash Raj. It is then that Parris' father reveals the truth that he had married twice and that Dhivya and Parris are siblings. Enraged, Parris leaves through the stairs where he meets the brother of Prakash Raj's second wife. He reveals the truth about Dhivya not being Prakash's daughter and that Parris can marry her. However, by the time Parris gets there, Dhivya has already gotten married, and so he leaves silently.
