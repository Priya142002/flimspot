            <h3>Naan Rajavaga Pogiren Movie</h3><br>
            <p>Jeeva is a Tamil-speaking young man living with his mother in some obscure Himachal Pradesh village. He is naive and plays with kids twice as young as him. He has a sleeping disorder and dozes off in the middle of important things, viz. the climax of Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Jeeva would be a hard eight a book of weirdness. One day, a military serviceman mistakes him for a classmate named Raja from Chennai who looks just like him. After showing a few videos of Raja, he convinces Jeeva to leave his life in Himachal to go seek his lookalike. Most of the movie is basically Jeeva getting to know about Raja by talking to someone close to the latter. These people talked about Raja as they knew him. This results in a series of flashbacks which guide Jeeva and us on his search for Raja. We meet Raja's closest friend who has feelings for him. Through her, we go into another flashback and meet Valli who Raja had feelings for.
